Template for Orange Pilling your Employer

The attached document is a template the aspirational Orange Piller can use to persuade an employer to pilot a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy.

Note that the formatting, template, and word choice used in this document was derived from existing internal template, so I would recommend porting the concepts and ideas over to a format your organization is accustomed to.

The main goal of this document is to be more professional for how one goes about persuading key decision-makers at your company using a language and process they are more comfortable with.

This approach has been suprisingly effective for me so far and I hope it is of use to someone else out there.
